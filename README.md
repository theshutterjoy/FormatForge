# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
   - Add your Google AI API key to it:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   _Note: The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to your repository._

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
